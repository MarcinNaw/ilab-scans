## Internet-wide Scans for a Better Internet Welcome to GitHub Pages

You have probably contacted our scanning node because you see incoming scan traffic into your network. You do not need to worry, we are a research team focussing on improving the Internet security. Currently, we are monitoring the landscape of amplification attacks.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/MarcinNaw/scans-haw/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

# DNS Scans

You have probably contacted our scanning node because you see incoming DNS scan traffic into your network. You do not need to worry, we are a research team focussing on DNS security.

## Counter-Measures

You do not want to be scanned? Read on.

### Your Blacklists

Our DNS scans have a fairly simple signature:

  1.  We use the default Zmap IP.ID (54321).
  2.  We initiate scans with the max TTL (255).
  3.  DNS Scan originate from a single IP address (141.22.28.227).
  
 We recommend configuring firewall rules for 1.+2. in your network. This way you will drop traffic from any other unwanted Zmap scan.

### Our Blacklists

Of course, we can also exclude your network from our scans. This way nothing will arrive at your edge. We just need your prefix.
